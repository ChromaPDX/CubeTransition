CubeTransition
==============

Example of how to transition between two views, using CATransform and UIKit Physics

This is a transition between views on a screen, not view controllers. Apple has lots of ways to do UIViewController
transitions, this is for doing transitions between smaller subviews.

iOS7 is required for UIKit Physics, and UIView SnapshotView
